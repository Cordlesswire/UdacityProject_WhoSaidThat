# UdacityProject_WhoSaidThat
This was a project during my Udacity Android Development Beginner Nanodegree. Who Said That? is a one-screen quiz that asks the users various questions in various formats (text, checkbox, radiobutton) and then lets them calculate the score, check for wrong answers, and share the scores.
